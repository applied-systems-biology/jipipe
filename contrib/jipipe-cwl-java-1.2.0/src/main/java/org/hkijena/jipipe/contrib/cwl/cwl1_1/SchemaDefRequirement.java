 This field consists of an array of type definitions which must be used when
 interpreting the `inputs` and `outputs` fields.  When a `type` field
 contain a IRI, the implementation must check if the type is defined in
 `schemaDefs` and use that definition.  If the type is not found in
 `schemaDefs`, it is an error.  The entries in `schemaDefs` must be
 processed in the order listed such that later schema definitions may refer
 to earlier schema definitions.
