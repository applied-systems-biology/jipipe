   * Only valid when `type: File` or is an array of `items: File`.
   * 
   * Provides a pattern or expression specifying files or
   * directories that should be included alongside the primary
   * file.  Secondary files may be required or optional.  When not
   * explicitly specified, secondary files specified for `inputs`
   * are required and `outputs` are optional.  An implementation
   * must include matching Files and Directories in the
   * `secondaryFiles` property of the primary file.  These Files
   * and Directories must be transferred and staged alongside the
   * primary file.  An implementation may fail workflow execution
   * if a required secondary file does not exist.
   * 
   * If the value is an expression, the value of `self` in the expression
   * must be the primary input or output File object to which this binding
   * applies.  The `basename`, `nameroot` and `nameext` fields must be
   * present in `self`.  For `CommandLineTool` outputs the `path` field must
   * also be present.  The expression must return a filename string relative
   * to the path to the primary File, a File or Directory object with either
   * `path` or `location` and `basename` fields set, or an array consisting
   * of strings or File or Directory objects.  It is legal to reference an
   * unchanged File or Directory object taken from input as a secondaryFile.
   * The expression may return "null" in which case there is no secondaryFile
   * from that expression.
   * 
   * To work on non-filename-preserving storage systems, portable tool
   * descriptions should avoid constructing new values from `location`, but
   * should construct relative references using `basename` or `nameroot`
   * instead.
   * 
   * If a value in `secondaryFiles` is a string that is not an expression,
   * it specifies that the following pattern should be applied to the path
   * of the primary file to yield a filename relative to the primary File:
   * 
   *   1. If string ends with `?` character, remove the last `?` and mark
   *     the resulting secondary file as optional.
   *   2. If string begins with one or more caret `^` characters, for each
   *     caret, remove the last file extension from the path (the last
   *     period `.` and all following characters).  If there are no file
   *     extensions, the path is unchanged.
   *   3. Append the remainder of the string to the end of the file path.
