      <description>JIPipe processes data so that each node completes all its tasks on all incoming data before the next step is executed. For large data sets, this can cause issues with RAM capacity.
To resolve this, JIPipe comes with loop control nodes that allow to setup a workflow where a set of nodes is repeatedly executed on a single input. Loops are a syntactic sugar around group nodes that also have loop capabilities, but lack cache support for the internal nodes.</description>
