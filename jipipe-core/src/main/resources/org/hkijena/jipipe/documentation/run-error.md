# Error during a run

I might occur that an analysis run cancels during its execution. The errors that
lead to this situation are displayed on the left-hand side.

There can be a variety of reason leading to the issue, such as:

* Unexpected or corrupted input data
* Missing data caused by the pipeline design
* Errors in the algorithm or JIPipe code
* Old JIPipe or plugin versions
* Incompatible plugins
* Insufficient system resources
* Insufficient permissions to write output data or access hardware
* ...

You can find suggested actions for each error on the left-hand side.

To contact a plugin author, find the plugin in `Plugins > Manage plugins` to 
get the contact details.
