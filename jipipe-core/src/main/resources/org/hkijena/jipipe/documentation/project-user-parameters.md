# Project-wide user parameters

Users can create and collect custom parameters in this panel with the purpose of 
simplifying the distribution of JIPipe pipelines. 

By default, the list of parameters is empty, but can be populated with a combination of 
items from three sources:

1. **Global parameters:** These parameters are stored inside the project and can be accessed through a variety of nodes from within the workflow
2. **Linked parameters:** You can reference parameters from nodes within the pipeline and collect them in this overview
3. **Directories:** A set of paths and directories that can be accessed via a variety of nodes and expression parameters. Useful for setting up input and output directories and making them easy to adapt.
