# JIPipe pipeline projects

JIPipe organizes pipelines in projects that can be saved and loaded from disk. Each pipeline is organized into 
**Compartments** that separate the whole graph into functional units. You can find an overview of all compartments
in the `Compartments` tab. You can re-open the tab by selecting `Compartment > Edit compartments` if you closed the tab.

By double-clicking a compartment in the overview, JIPipe will open an editor where you can modify the sub-pipeline
that is associated to the compartment. If you just want to run a project, you can find the `Run` button at the top-right
corner.

Pipeline developers might have organized a set of most common pipeline parameters. You can find them in `Project > Project overview`
alongside additional information like the authors, citations, and website.
