# Data slots

Nodes process input data to generate output data. To provide inputs and further process outputs, each node has a set of input and output slots that are located at the top (inputs) and 
the bottom (outputs) of the node.

Some nodes allow you to add additional slots. To add another slot, click the ![](resource://icons/actions/list-add.png)
add button, select the slot type, and provide a name.
