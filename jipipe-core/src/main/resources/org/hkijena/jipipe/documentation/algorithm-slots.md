# Data slots

Algorithms process input data to generate output data. The input and output can be 
addressed as individual *data slots* that are left and right to the colored area of 
an algorithm node. 

**Input data slots** are located on the left side

**Output data slots** are located on the right side

Some algorithms allow you to add additional slots. To add another slot, click the ![](resource://icons/actions/list-add.png)
add button and select which data type the slot should have.
