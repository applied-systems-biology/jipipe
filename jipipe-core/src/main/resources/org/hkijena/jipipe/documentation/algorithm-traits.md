# Data annotations

JIPipe allows you to annotate data with certain predefined traits. These annotations
allow you to select an optimal algorithm for your data. Annotations are carried over
by algorithms to the next steps, unless an algorithm specifically removes an annotation.

To annotate data, click the ![](image://icons/label.png) *Annotate* button within
a data slot. Then select the annotations.
