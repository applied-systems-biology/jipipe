# Welcome to JIPipe!

*JIPipe* is a graphical batch processing programming language for *ImageJ* that allows you to create macros without the need for programming.

To create a pipeline, switch to one of the already open tabs at the top. If you create a new project, there is
always one tab to manage <img src="image://icons/actions/straight-connector.png"/> <strong>Graph compartments</strong> and multiple 
<img src="image://icons/data-types/graph-compartment.png"/> <strong>Compartment</strong> items.
Compartments are a way to organize large pipelines into smaller sub-graphs. You can create as many compartments as you want 
and pass data between them. Please take a look at out online tutorials for step-by-step explanations.

On switching to a <img src="image://icons/data-types/graph-compartment.png"/> <strong>Compartment</strong>, you can add algorithms 
into the pipeline. You can find them in the menu or via the <i>Search ...</i> bar. Each algorithm has a set of input and
output <i>slots</i>. Inputs must always have a connection, while outputs can be left alone. JIPipe will automatically save all
generated outputs.

To run a pipeline, click the <img src="image://icons/actions/run-build.png"/> <strong>Run</strong> button at the top-right corner.
You can also run only a part of the pipeline via the <img src="image://icons/actions/media-play.png"/> <strong>Quick Run</strong>
feature that can be set up via right-clicking an algorithm node or selecting it.
