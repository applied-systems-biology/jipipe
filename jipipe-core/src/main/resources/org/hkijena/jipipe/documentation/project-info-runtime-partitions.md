# Runtime partitions

Runtime partitions are a central point to determine how certain parts of the pipeline are executed. By default, nodes are assigned to the `Default` partition. To assign a 
node to a different partition, use the context menu of the node or the `Runtime partition` parameter. Alternatively, you can also assign all nodes within a compartment to a partition 
by using the compartment context menu.
