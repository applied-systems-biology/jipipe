      <description>JIPipe has various dependencies in form of ImageJ update sites that are not always provided via the Fiji update site or the ZIP package. During the startup of the software, JIPipe will automatically check for the appropriate ImageJ update sites and will guide you through the installation of all necessary libraries.
The dependency installation was revised in JIPipe version 1.74.0. Please follow the appropriate procedures in the tutorial below.

      <description>If you are installing JIPipe via the ImageJ updater site, you might have noticed a directory jars/omero that will be downloaded with the package.
It contains the absolute minimum of files to use OMERO for uploading and downloading images. We cannot guarantee that the JIPipe-provided OMERO libraries are compatible with your server setup or sufficient for any task outside basic image uploading and downloading.
ðŸ‘‰ We strongly recommend to install one of the OMERO packages from the ImageJ updater.</description>
