      <description>What are those compartments for? Imagine you have a large complicated pipeline. Most certainly, you could split it into multiple sub-pipelines like &amp;ldquo;preprocessing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;segmentation&amp;rdquo;. Compartments allow you to do exactly this.
What is the difference between groups and compartments? If you use compartments, JIPipe is still aware of the whole pipeline. This allows it to run all dependency nodes via Update cache or Quick run. Groups are independent pipelines that are not aware where they are used.</description>

      <description>Can I use plugins from ImageJ in JIPipe? Yes. Either there is an integration available, or you just use the macro node and input the corresponding macro code that runs the plugin.
Can I use existing ImageJ macros in JIPipe? Yes, use Images &amp;gt; ImageJ macro. The input slots are opened as image windows and can be addressed from within the macro with selectWindow(). You can also load an example that shows how to use the node.</description>
