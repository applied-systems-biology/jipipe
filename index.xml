      <description>Where do I find documentations? You can find all documentations in the  menu at the top right.
There are also context-based documentations available if you select a node in the graph. Hover your mouse over a parameter to show documentations for this parameter only.
Does JIPipe have a backup function? Yes. By default, JIPipe creates a backup every 3 minutes. You can recover it via Project &amp;gt; Restore Backup.</description>

      <description>Does JIPipe have a dark mode? Yes, you can enable it in Project &amp;gt; Application settings &amp;gt; UI &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Theme. Set the theme to Modern dark and restart JIPipe/ImageJ.
How can I make long connections without zooming out? Click the arrow button at the input/output slot. It lists all compatible sources/targets ordered by distance.
Why is the user interface suddenly messed up on Windows? This is a known issue with the open/save dialogs that are used on Windows.</description>

      <description>What are those compartments for? Imagine you have a large complicated pipeline. Most certainly, you could split it into multiple sub-pipelines like &amp;ldquo;preprocessing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;segmentation&amp;rdquo;. Compartments allow you to do exactly this.
What is the difference between groups and compartments? If you use compartments, JIPipe is still aware of the whole pipeline. This allows it to run all dependency nodes via Update cache or Quick run. Groups are independent pipelines that are not aware where they are used.</description>

      <description>Can I use plugins from ImageJ in JIPipe? Yes. Either there is an integration available, or you just use the macro node and input the corresponding macro code that runs the plugin.
Can I use existing ImageJ macros in JIPipe? Yes, use Images &amp;gt; ImageJ macro. The input slots are opened as image windows and can be addressed from within the macro with selectWindow(). You can also load an example that shows how to use the node.</description>

      <description>Can I open a table in ImageJ instead of JIPipe or vice versa? Yes, and even more: Depending on the data type there are multiple options on displaying data available. Select the data in the result view or cache browser and click the ... button at the bottom. JIPipe will even remember the last setting for you.
Can I save data by their metadata? Yes, use the node Miscellaneous &amp;gt; Export data.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/batch-pipelines/</guid>
      <description>JIPipe was designed to always process data in batches, meaning that algorithms always work on multiple data sets at once. This greatly reduces the required work to upscale a processing pipeline from one or few to a large amount of data sets.
We will use this pipeline as example:
mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});graph LR;A[File] -- B[Load image]B -- C[Apply gaussian] In the pipeline, a file is provided as input. Then the file is loaded as image.</description>

      <title>Handling multiple inputs</title>
      <link>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/iterating-algorithms/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/iterating-algorithms/</guid>
      <description>JIPipe data slots store multiple data rows. This means that algorithms have to iterate their workload for each input row and generate equivalent output in the respective output slots.
There can be issues if data from multiple input slots need to be combined (e.g. merge channels into RGB, see user documentation). JIPipeAlgorithm has no capabilities to help with such cases.
A solution can be JIPipeIteratingAlgorithm or JIPipeSimpleIteratingAlgorithm that use the annotation attached during processing to find data rows that belong to the same data set.</description>

      <description>After processing, users should be able to continue processing the data from within JIPipe. The data instances are cleared from memory after processing, meaning that the data needs to be loaded from its output folder after processing.
An user interface is shown when a user select a row in the results table. There are two ways to modify the user interface:
 Registering additional operations that will be available to users (recommended) Replacing the interface with a custom one  Adding custom operations JIPipe already comes with some default operations, such as opening the containing folder.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/merging-algorithms/</guid>
      <description>You might need to develop an algorithm that does not simply iterate through its input(s), but organize it into groups to be merged. JIPipe comes with JIPipeMergingAlgorithm that uses the annotation attached during processing to find data rows that belong to the same data set. The implementation creates JIPipeMergingDataBatch instances that represent multiple data rows merged into one group.
Please access data via the data interface.
The only difference to JIPipeAlgorithm is that you need to override a different function called runIteration.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/slot-configuration/</guid>
      <description>In the previous examples, we used the @AlgorithmInputSlot and @AlgorithmOutputSlot annotations with autoCreate = true to automatically configure the slots.
This is not sufficient for more complicated algorithms that require
 Restricting the number of slots Restricting the allowed data types Users to add more slots or remove existing ones  A custom JIPipeSlotConfiguration can be used to implement such more advanced behaviors.
For many cases, the default implementation JIPipeMutableSlotConfiguration is sufficient.</description>

      <description>The ImageJ integration library integrates common data types from ImageJ into JIPipe:
 Multi-dimensional images (ImagePlus). The standard output file format are TIFF files. Result tables. They are serialized to CSV files. Region of interest (ROI Manager). JIPipe handles ROI as *.zip files.  The ImageJ data types are marked as accessible from outside JIPipe, meaning that algorithms that only use those types can be executed standalone
Image data types Various ImageJ algorithms only work on data with a specific color type, or dimensionality.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/data-type/result-preview/</guid>
      <description>While JIPipeData allows you to define a custom function for previewing, this only works for data already present in memory. To allow previewing of data stored in a results folder, you need to suppy a JIPipeResultDataSlotPreviewUI that loads the data from disk and generates a preview. We recommend to use JIPipeAsyncResultDataPlotPreviewUI This class will offload the loading and preview generation into a separate thread to prevent the UI from freezing. By default it will use the already defined importFrom(Path) method present in the JIPipeData class and use its already defined preview function.</description>

      <description>The macro node allows to run existing ImageJ macros or execute algorithms that are not directly available as JIPipe nodes. You will find it in Images &amp;gt; ImageJ Macro.
Inputs and outputs By default, the node has no inputs and outputs. Use to the + button to add them. For example, if you want to process one image and output the processed result, create one input and one output.
By default, there are four data types that can be used as input and output:</description>

      <description>When using nodes that filter or generate data, you might encounter a parameter type called &amp;ldquo;Expression&amp;rdquo;. This parameter allows to to write simple to complex functions that can test for one or multiple conditions or act as input for a generator node. The basic concept of this expression language is to mix string, boolean, and numeric operations into one simple but powerful language. It allows you for example to first calculate a numeric metric and use it for filtering objects within one line.</description>

      <description>The JIPipe standard library contains data types and algorithms to apply file system operations. The common use case is to extract the list of input files for the following algorithms.
The filesystem library has two basic data types:
 A  File contains a path to a file A  Folder contains a path to a folder A Path contains a path to a file or folder  In the Add data menu you can define one file/folder or a list of files/folders.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/graph-compartment/</guid>
      <description>A common issue with graphical programming languages is that large graphs are hard to navigate. JIPipe solves this issue by separating the pipeline graph into sub-graphs. Each sub-graph has a predetermined output node that is visible to other compartments. Other nodes on the other hand are not visible to other compartments.
The difference between compartments and simple node groups is that compartments only communicate with each other via the compartment output node.</description>

      <description>Most algorithms allow handling of multiple parameters via an additional slot that can be optionally enabled. You can find the setting in an algorithm&amp;rsquo;s settings as Multiple parameters. On selecting the item, a new slot will appear that consumes parameter data.
To define parameters, use the algorithms found in Add data &amp;gt; Parameters. There are currently two data source algorithms available:
 Define parameter defines a single set of parameters Define multiple parameters lets you define a table of parameters  Use Process &amp;gt; Merge &amp;gt; Merge slots to merge multiple parameter sets.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/parameters/</guid>
      <description>You can add parameters to your algorithm by creating a property with a getter and setter. Then you annotate the getter and setter with the same @JIPipeParameter keys. Also add an @JIPipeDocumentation annotation to either the getter or setter.
Parameters are automatically serialized and deserialized.
Please make sure to send an event when the parameter is set, so the UI can update.

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/parallelization/</guid>
      <description>The current version of JIPipe supports parallelization via a fixed thread pool. Parallelization is done on an per-algorithm-level, meaning that the algorithms are responsible for providing parallelization capabilities.
The included base algorithms JIPipeIteratingAlgorithm, JIPipeSimpleIteratingAlgorithm, and JIPipeMergingAlgorithm already come with support for parallelization that has to be manually enabled via code. The inherit from JIPipeParallelizedAlgorithm and completely apply parallelization automatically.
Automated parallelization (JIPipeParallelizedAlgorithm) The automated parallelization is controlled by three factors:</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation-java-api/algorithm/custom-info/</guid>
      <description>In the previous tutorials we used the standard way of creating algorithms. This might not be sufficient if you want to generate algorithms, for example by importing ImageJ algorithms, loading algorithms from JSON or generate algorithms for an unknown list of data types.
How algorithms are registered Algorithm instances are created by an JIPipeNodeInfo. This info is the object that is actually registered into JIPipe. It is able to create new instances of the declared algorithm, or copy it.</description>

      <description>JIPipe stores its results in a user-defined output folder. After clicking  Run (located at the top right corner of a project window) JIPipe will query the output folder from you. You can also generate a random folder that will be located on your operating system&amp;rsquo;s temporary directory by clicking the button.
After confirming the settings by clicking  Run now, JIPipe will start processing the pipeline.
You can have as many runs as you want.</description>

      <description>Context actions allow you to add custom buttons into an algorithm&amp;rsquo;s parameter group that by default will also appear within a node&amp;rsquo;s context menu. They can be used for multiple purposes such as loading example data, applying an auto-configuration, opening websites, or displaying documentation or data in a new tab.
To create one, annotate a public function with @JIPipeDocumentation and @JIPipeContextAction. The function should have one parameter: an instance of JIPipeWorkbench.</description>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/quick-run/</guid>
      <description>Many algorithms require plenty of user-defined parameters to create the expected results. Finding those parameters on the other hand can be very time-consuming due to the requirement of repeating all previous and following processing steps.
JIPipe comes with a feature termed Quick Run that makes it easier to only test a part of an analysis pipeline. You can find the testbench by selecting an algorithm in the algorithm graph and selecting the  Quick Run tab.</description>

      <description>JIPipe has a project-wide cache for generated results. This cache can be accessed by algorithms to prevent repeating previous calculation steps.
Load data into the cache To cache data, right click a node and click  Update cache. This will execute a Quick run and store all results into the cache.
Accessing the cache Cache items are assigned a unique identifier ( Snapshot) that is based on relevant algorithm parameters and the processing pipeline behind the data generation.</description>

      <description>ImageJ to JIPipe JIPipe integrates commonly used data types and popular algorithms from ImageJ. If an algorithm is not available for JIPipe, you can still run them via the Macro node. There is also a Python script node available that behaves similar to the macro node.
JIPipe to ImageJ JIPipe algorithms and pipelines can be executed from within an ImageJ environment. There are two ways JIPipe integrates back into ImageJ:</description>

      <description>JIPipe has its own plugin (extension) system that is independent of the one provided by ImageJ/SciJava. You can find a list of plugins in Plugins &amp;gt; Manage plugins.
JIPipe by default supports two types of extensions:
 Java extensions are similar to ImageJ plugins (*.jar) and are the most powerful plugin type. Just like ImageJ plugins, they are located in the plugins directory. JSON plugins are similar to ImageJ macros or scripts, as they are pure text files.</description>

      <description>The standard library contains algorithms and data types that allows to manipulate tables, and create plots. The table data type is the JIPipe wrapper for the ImageJ results table (see ImageJ integration).
Manipulating tables Table manipulation operations are located in Process &amp;gt; Tables and allow you to add, remove, or replace columns.
Creating plots Plots can be created via the Analyze &amp;gt; Plot &amp;gt; Plot tables algorithm that processes each incoming result table and produces an automatically generated plot.</description>

      <description>The JIPipe API allows you to run algorithms, graphs, and projects in a pure Java environment without the need for a GUI or through ImageJ1 or ImageJ2 scripts.
Prerequisites To use the JIPipe API JIPipe must be initialized first. This requires an ImageJ instance or any other way to load SciJava plugins. The following example shows how to initialize JIPipe.
public static void main(String[] args) {// Extract necessary SciJava variables // An alternative is to create a @Plugin and execute this plugin via ImageJ final ImageJ ij = new ImageJ();Context context = ij.</description>
