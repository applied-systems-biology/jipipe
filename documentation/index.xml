      <title>Batch pipelines</title>

      <description>JIPipe was designed to always process data in batches, meaning that algorithms always work on multiple data sets at once. This greatly reduces the required work to upscale a processing pipeline from one or few to a large amount of data sets.
We will use this pipeline as example:
mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph LR;A[File] -- B[Load image]B -- C[Apply gaussian] In the pipeline, a file is provided as input. Then the file is loaded as image.</description>

      <title>Pipeline editor</title>

      <description>This guide is also available as video tutorial.The graph editor (pipeline editor) allows you to edit the processing steps of a graph compartment. Its user interface is separated into three sections:
 The analysis graph contains the processing steps (also referred as algorithms) The settings panel shows the properties of the currently selected algorithms The toolbar allows you to add more algorithms into the graph, navigate to existing algorithms, change some behavior settings of the graph editor, and create screenshots  Analysis graph The analysis graph contains algorithms that are represented by rectangles.</description>

      <title>Expression parameters</title>

      <description>When using nodes that filter or generate data, you might encounter a parameter type called &amp;ldquo;Expression&amp;rdquo;. This parameter allows to to write simple to complex functions that can test for one or multiple conditions or act as input for a generator node. The basic concept of this expression language is to mix string, boolean, and numeric operations into one simple but powerful language. It allows you for example to first calculate a numeric metric and use it for filtering objects within one line.</description>

      <title>Graph compartments</title>

      <description>A common issue with graphical programming languages is that large graphs are hard to navigate. JIPipe solves this issue by separating the pipeline graph into sub-graphs. Each sub-graph has a predetermined output node that is visible to other compartments. Other nodes on the other hand are not visible to other compartments.
The difference between compartments and simple node groups is that compartments only communicate with each other via the compartment output node.</description>

      <title>Running a pipeline</title>
      <link>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/result-analysis/</link>

      <description>JIPipe stores its results in a user-defined output folder. After clicking  Run (located at the top right corner of a project window) JIPipe will query the output folder from you. You can also generate a random folder that will be located on your operating system&amp;rsquo;s temporary directory by clicking the button.
After confirming the settings by clicking  Run now, JIPipe will start processing the pipeline.
You can have as many runs as you want.</description>

      <title>Running a single node</title>

      <description>Many algorithms require plenty of user-defined parameters to create the expected results. Finding those parameters on the other hand can be very time-consuming due to the requirement of repeating all previous and following processing steps.
JIPipe comes with a feature termed Quick Run that makes it easier to only test a part of an analysis pipeline. You can find the testbench by selecting an algorithm in the algorithm graph and selecting the  Quick Run tab.</description>

      <title>Data caching</title>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/cache/</guid>
      <description>JIPipe has a project-wide cache for generated results. This cache can be accessed by algorithms to prevent repeating previous calculation steps.
Load data into the cache To cache data, right click a node and click  Update cache. This will execute a Quick run and store all results into the cache.
Accessing the cache Cache items are assigned a unique identifier ( Snapshot) that is based on relevant algorithm parameters and the processing pipeline behind the data generation.</description>

      <description>ImageJ to JIPipe JIPipe integrates commonly used data types and popular algorithms from ImageJ. If an algorithm is not available for JIPipe, you can still run them via the Macro node. There is also a Python script node available that behaves similar to the macro node.
JIPipe to ImageJ JIPipe algorithms and pipelines can be executed from within an ImageJ environment. There are two ways JIPipe integrates back into ImageJ:</description>

      <title>Managing plugins</title>
      <link>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/plugins/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/plugins/</guid>
      <description>JIPipe has its own plugin (extension) system that is independent of the one provided by ImageJ/SciJava. You can find a list of plugins in Plugins &amp;gt; Manage plugins.
JIPipe by default supports two types of extensions:
 Java extensions are similar to ImageJ plugins (*.jar) and are the most powerful plugin type. Just like ImageJ plugins, they are located in the plugins directory. JSON plugins are similar to ImageJ macros or scripts, as they are pure text files.</description>

      <title>Command Line Interface</title>
      <link>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/cli/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jipipe.org/documentation/cli/</guid>
      <description>You can run JIPipe pipelines without a graphical interface via the command line.
Just run following command:
./ImageJ --pass-classpath --full-classpath --main-class org.hkijena.jipipe.JIPipeCLI run --project &amp;lt;project file&amp;gt; --output-folder &amp;lt;output folder&amp;gt; Command line options ./ImageJ --pass-classpath --full-classpath --main-class org.hkijena.jipipe.JIPipeCLI run &amp;lt;options&amp;gt;  --project &amp;lt;Project file&amp;gt; provides the project file to be executed --output-folder &amp;lt;folder&amp;gt; defines where outputs will be written. Outputs are in standard JIPipe format. Optional: --num-threads &amp;lt;N=1,2,3,...&amp;gt; lets you enable multi-threading Optional: --overwrite-parameters &amp;lt;JSON file&amp;gt; allows you to overwrite specific parameters without the need for changing the project file Optional: --P&amp;lt;Node ID&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;Parameter ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Parameter value JSON&amp;gt; overwrites a specific parameter with the specified value  Overwriting parameters The JIPipe project file contains all parameters of a project.</description>
