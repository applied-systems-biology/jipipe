      <description>If you are familiar with ImageJ, you already know how processing is applied in this software: All operations are directly applied after selecting them in the graphical user interface (GUI). For example, a simple analysis protocol would consist of opening the image via File &amp;gt; Open, applying a Gaussian Blur filter, and then thresholding the image via Otsu&amp;rsquo;s method.
This allows to easily develop image analysis protocols that can be manually adjusted if needed.</description>

      <description>JIPipe was designed to always process data in batches, meaning that algorithms always work on multiple data sets at once. This greatly reduces the required work to upscale a processing pipeline from one or few to a large amount of data sets.
We will use this pipeline as example:
mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph LR;A[File] -- B[Load image]B -- C[Apply gaussian] In the pipeline, a file is provided as input. Then the file is loaded as image.</description>
