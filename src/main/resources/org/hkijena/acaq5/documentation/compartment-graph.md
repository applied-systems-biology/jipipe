# Organizing analyses

ACAQ5 allows you to organize an analysis pipeline into multiple *compartments* that interact via 
predefined output nodes. This graph allows you to setup compartments, and connect them together.

## Data slots

Connections are made between *data slots* that are left and right to the colored area of 
an compartment node. 

**Input data slots** are located on the left side

**Output data slots** are located on the right side

### Connecting data

To connect slots, click the ![](image://icons/chevron-right.png) icon to open a menu of
compatible source or target data slots. On creating a connection, a line will appear between
the two affected slots to indicate a connection.

To disconnect two slots, click ![](image://icons/chevron-right.png) and select 
the ![](image://icons/remove.png) disconnect command.

### Multiple inputs

Compartments allow multiple inputs. To add another slot, click the ![](image://icons/add.png)
add button and select ![](image://icons/data-types/graph-compartment.png) *Output data*.
