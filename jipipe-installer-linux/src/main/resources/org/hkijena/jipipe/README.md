# JIPipe installer for Linux

Welcome to the JIPipe installer for Linux!

This installer will **download** Fiji from https://fiji.sc/ and extract the Fiji instance to the selected installation path.
Afterwards, the ImageJ updater will be run to install ImageJ dependencies from the official ImageJ repositories.

You can choose to create launcher icons for the application menu at the right-hand side.

If you point the installer to a directory that already contains a `Fiji.app` folder, the installer will not re-download Fiji, but instead install
JIPipe into the existing installation.

On installing JIPipe, you agree to the licenses of JIPipe (see below) and the licenses of ImageJ, Fiji, and dependencies.

If you require any assistance, please feel free to contact us via E-Mail or the community (see https://www.jipipe.org/).
